# Particles to pixels paper

This repository contains the code required to build the plots and results contained in the accepted journal article being prepared for MNRAS. 

Running each of the R scripts in order will produce the files created in `data/` and `sim_anlaysis/`, as well as the figures of the paper in `plots/`.

For further information on the SimSpin code, please check out the SimSpin repo at [kateharborne/SimSpin](https://github.com/kateharborne/SimSpin).
